# NHL_Match_Scores
I created a program that displays hockey matches played today and each team's respective score.

How I did it <br />
• Set up Visual Studio Code on an Ubuntu virtual machine in order to utilize libcurl, an API library.
• Used libcurl to call the NHL API to retrieve JSON-formatted data which was then parsed by putting each match into a game object and outputted to the terminal.
• Modularized functions into classes, created a make file for functionality, and header files for readability.

What technologies and languages I used: <br />
WSL, libcurl, C++, JSON
